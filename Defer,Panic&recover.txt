

    Defer:  In golang,the defer keyword is used to delay the execution of a function (or)statement until the nearby
   function returns.In simple words,defer will move the execution of the statement to the very end inside a
   function.

   Panic :  The panic() function in golang is similar to exceptions raised at runtime when an error is encountered.
   Panic() is either raised by the program itself when an unexpected error occurs or the programmer throws the 
   exception on purpose for handling particular errors.

  Recover : The recover() function only works when called in a deferred function.This is because when a panic 
  occurs,deferred functions do not exit or crash as a normal function would.
